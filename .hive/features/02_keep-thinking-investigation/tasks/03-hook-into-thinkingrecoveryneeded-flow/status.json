  "summary": "Hooked thinking_signature_invalid into the THINKING_RECOVERY_NEEDED flow. Updated request.ts line 1597 to throw recovery error for both thinking_block_order AND thinking_signature_invalid. When thrown, plugin.ts sets forceThinkingRecovery=true, which triggers closeToolLoopForThinking() -> stripAllThinkingBlocks() on retry. This ensures conversation continues with stripped thinking when signature validation fails.",
