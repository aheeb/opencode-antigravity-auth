  "summary": "Added thinking_signature_invalid error type to recovery system. Added detection patterns for \"invalid signature\", \"failed to process + thinking\", \"invalid_request + thinking\", \"signature + thinking\", and \"thinking + validation\". Created recoverThinkingSignatureInvalid handler that strips all thinking blocks (like keep_thinking=false) to allow conversation to continue. Added toast messages. Added 5 new tests (34 total pass).",
